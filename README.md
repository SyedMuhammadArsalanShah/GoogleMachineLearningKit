## Overview
This repository contains various Android applications implementing Google's **Machine Learning Kit** features. Each application demonstrates the use of Google's ML Kit APIs to perform real-time recognition, detection, and classification tasks.

## Features
This project includes the following ML Kit-powered applications:

### 1. **Barcode Scanning**
   - Scans and processes barcodes in real-time.
   - Supports most standard **1D and 2D formats**.

### 2. **Face Detection**
   - Detects faces and identifies facial landmarks.
   - Can be used for security and facial recognition applications.

### 3. **Face Mesh Detection** (NEW)
   - Detects **face mesh info** on close-range images.
   - Used in augmented reality and facial tracking.

### 4. **Text Recognition v2**
   - Recognizes and extracts **text from images**.
   - Works for multiple languages and handwriting recognition.

### 5. **Image Labeling**
   - Identifies **objects, locations, activities, animal species, and products**.
   - Uses a **general-purpose TensorFlow Lite model** or a custom ML model.

### 6. **Object Detection and Tracking**
   - Detects and tracks **one or multiple objects** in real-time.
   - Useful for surveillance, retail, and autonomous systems.

### 7. **Digital Ink Recognition**
   - Recognizes **handwritten text** and drawn shapes.
   - Supports **300+ languages, emojis, and basic shapes**.

### 8. **Pose Detection**
   - Detects the **position of the human body** in real-time.
   - Used for **fitness apps, sports analysis, and healthcare**.

### 9. **Selfie Segmentation**
   - Removes the background from selfies.
   - Helps create **virtual backgrounds** for video calls.

### 10. **Subject Segmentation** (NEW)
   - Separates subjects (**people, pets, or objects**) from the background.
   - Used for **photo editing and AR applications**.

### 11. **Document Scanner** (NEW)
   - Digitizes **physical documents** from pictures.
   - Useful for **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** applications.
